What's good, bad and why you should try them...

This game is an absolutely phenomenal example of story telling in games, as it relies very heavily on it to be compelling, and it succeeds. This is probably my favorite game of all time and one of only two to have brought tears to my eyes (I do not cry easily). It is one of the few games to hold the prestigious badges of 'Overwhelmingly Positive' on steam with over 50,000 reviews at 97% positive. 

**The Good:** 
* Beautiful, handmade artwork.
* A rich and compelling story which explores both the serious and silly, happy and dark.
* A large, bizarre, creative  and memorable map, characters and environments.
* Banger soundtrack
* I could gush about this game for like an hour

**The Bad:**
* To say anything about this game is 'bad', is definitely being to harsh, however the game's combat encounters are rather rock-paper-scissory, sort of like pokemon style RPG combat. 

Overall, 10/10. If you are looking for something to play, Omori is a phenomenal and memorable experience. A word of caution though: This game goes to some pretty dark places, such as self harm and suicide, so discretion is advised!

## 2. Lunacid

Lunacid is a Kingsfield (parent series to Dark Souls) inspired, Dark-Fantasy exploration dungeon-crawler. This game will see you wander through dank, bizarre, mystical and spooky underground environments and meet a charming cast of characters. 

**The Good:**
* This game has an incredibly well put together atmosphere and environments, which are all tied together by its soundtrack which complements them excellently.
* The game has a great variety of spells to find, which range from summoning coffins to stack upwards to reach new areas, to lightning nuke spells and "summon snail". 
* Very good level design, with plenty of hidden secrets and shortcuts to unlock

**The Bad:**
* Being inspired by a 30 year old game, the combat, while not the focus of the game, is not anything special. Should you choose to spec into a melee build, you will find the combat mostly consist of Hit, back up, hit, back up, hit, back up. Magic is a lot more interesting anyways.
* If you are impatient with exploration or problem solving, this game may not be for you. There is fast travel, but no map or really any guide or help of any kind. I found that there were maybe 1-2 points where I wandered in circles for several hours before consulting google.

Overall, 8/10. This is an extremely impressive game considering it was made by a solo developer. This game is not that difficult, so I think a wide variety of players can enjoy it, but maybe not everyone will have the patience for it. It can be a little slow at points, but the exploration is genuinely maybe-probably the best of any game I have played! 
## 3. Nine Sols

Nine Sols is an indie game made by Taiwanese studio "RedCandleGames". It is a 2D metroidvania not dissimilar to games like Hollow Knight or Ori and the Will of the Wisps. It has a strong emphasis on combat and an extremely detailed world, lore and story to explore.

**The Good:**
* Absolutely beautiful artwork and environments.
* Well-polished, parry based combat with excellent boss fights.
* Well made and compelling characters.

**The Bad:**
* A very steep learning curve which can put players off of the game.
* The level design is not *bad*, but does not really match the quality of the rest of the game.

Overall, 8/10. If you are looking for a challenging souls-like Metroidvania which can hold it's own against the likes of Silksong, you will enjoy this game.

## 4. Besiege

https://store.steampowered.com/app/346010/Besiege/

Besiege is a physics-based, destructive, puzzle solving sort of game where you build a siege machine with a set of blocks in order to solve problems or destroy something. It recently got a DLC which adds boat's and water mechanics!

**The Good:**
* Great variety of unique and interesting levels which are both fun and challenging
* Has a great visual sense of style.
* Despite being a physics-based game, it runs pretty well on most systems

**The Bad:**
* The difference in difficulty between levels can be a bit inconsistent
* The number of levels in the game is rather small (~25 without the DLC)

Overall, 7/10. Definitely for a certain type of person, but if you enjoy building machines and creative challenges, you will probably like this game.

## 5. Amnesia: The Dark Descent

Many people have probably heard of Amnesia, many YouTuber's such as Pewdiepie  made let's plays about it back around ~2012, however I'm willing to bet most readers have probably not played the game themselves, which is  a real shame. As far as horror games go, this one is fantastic and easily one of the greats!

**The Good:**
* Excellent atmosphere and pacing
* Has a good mix of 'genre's of scariness which don't wear off or loose effectiveness throughout the experience. Despite being a horror game, there are not many jump-scares.
* Great mystery story and storytelling which is compelling and never fully resolved.
* Interesting and engaging puzzles

**The Bad:**
* Being a rather old game, it's mechanics may feel a bit dated to some by today's standards.
* Some player's complain about the lack of accessibility settings which can disable nausea or screen sway effects.
* I'm struggling to find negatives, it has  "overwhelmingly positive" rating on steam!

Overall: 9/10. I don't typically play horror genre games, but Amnesia is one that I starkly recall even after having not touched the game for about 5 years.
